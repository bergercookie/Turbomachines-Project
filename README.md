Problem Set:
=============


Problem 1:
------------

1-D mathematical analysis of an axial turbine
1. find 6 pairs of phi-psi points for 3 given efficient rates: htt = 0.9, 0.925, 0.95
2. find the maximum efficient rate for the current circumstances: r -> known

Problem 2: 
------------

Was implemented solely on paper so there is no code written for it

Problem 3:
------------

1-D analysis of a 7-stage compressor
1. Calculate the thermodynamic properties and the velocities (absolute & relative) of every single position,
   3 positions at each stage. 1-entrance to rotor, 2-after the rotor, 
   before the stator, after the stator (beginning of next stage)
   Also calculate the losses of every stage
2. Calculate the polytropic & isentropic efficient rates of every rotor & stage of the compressor
   Also calculate the exponential of the polytropic process of every rotor & stage
3. Print out nicely each one of those values
